# Hacking

Collection of sripts and cheat sheets for hacking

## Linux
In linux you find:
Simple Http Server serving files for downloads (like netcat for windows). Which you can use further
Revers shell Listeners (featuring Netcat and OpenSSL)
And collection of reverse shells

## Windows
Collection of revers shells

## With flipper-zero
Also check my collection of [BadUSB](https://github.com/kindljiri/flipper-zero/tree/main/badUSB) script for flipper-zero, it contains revershells so if you combine flipper-zero, Andriod phone and termux you can start revershell listener on your phone, update the badUSB reversshell script with your phone IP (when starting listener it will show).
Connect flipper to to your target device and run badUSB and enjoy ... ;-)
